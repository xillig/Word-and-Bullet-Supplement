The repository only consists of the final pipeline used to train the LDA Model and the subsequent analysis. The pipeline makes firstly use of "far_near_enemy_pagewise.ipynb" and then of "far_near_enemy_pagewise_5_topic_estimation.ipynb". Files that are loaded into notebooks, like "most_occurring_words_modified.txt", can be provided on request. Additional material, like the "Alittihad News Corpora" or ISIS "Al-Naba" Magazine issues can not be provided due to file size or legal restictions.
